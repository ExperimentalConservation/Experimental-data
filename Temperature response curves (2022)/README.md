## Temperature response curves 

## Introduction

Data on the temperature responses of protist species used in the Experimental Ecology & Conservation group. Experiments carried out in 2022 by Ellie Wolfe.

# Data structure

Consists of two data files, one for the growth rates at different temperatures, and one for temperatures where populations decline (sampled at a higher frequency) which gives estimates of negative growth rates from the starting experimental abundances.
