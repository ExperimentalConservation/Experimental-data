# Experimental-data

## Introduction

Data from Clements, C., Collen, B., Blackburn, T., Petchey, O. Effects of directional environmental change on extinction dynamics in experimental microbial communities are predicted by a simple model. Oikos, 123, 141-150​

## Structure

Jar - a unique code for each microcosm.

Species - What species the count data for (Paramecium caudate. Loxocephalus sp., Blepharimsa japonicum)

Treatment - a character vector specifying which of the temperature change treatments the microcosm is in

Replicate - which replicate of the community is this (1-3).

Sample.Day - the experimental setup and monitoring was offset (half started on a Monday, half on a Tuesday) to allow this number of microcosms to be sampled by a single person. This column specifies which block each microcosm falls into.

Community - a column specifying which of the 7 community treatments (species kept individually, in pairs, or all three species together) the data are for

Species.Richness - a column specifying how many species were in the Community

Abundance - the estimated total abundance of each species present in the microcosm

## Treatments

There were two fully factorial treatment levels. 

### Community 

Each microcosm consisted of either 1, 2, or 3 species added simultaneously to the microcosms (see below).

### Temperature 

The nine temperature treatments comprised of one (termed treatment C) that was incubated at 20°C for the duration of the experiment (70 days) and eight treatments that were either heated or cooled. All heated treatments started at 20°C and finished at 26°C, and all cooled treatments started at 20°C and finished at 14°C, however the rate at which microcosms reached these final temperatures differed between treat- ments (Fig. 1). This was achieved by moving the treatments between nine incubators set at 1.5°C increments from 14°C to 26°C. Thus, the eight rates of cooling and heating were: 1) increasing by 3°C per week (I3), 2) decreasing 3°C per week (D3), 3) increasing 1.5°C per week (I1.5), 4) decreas- ing 1.5°C per week (D1.5), 5) increasing 1.5°C every two weeks (I0.75), 6) decreasing 1.5°C every two weeks (D0.75), 7) increasing 1.5°C every three weeks (I0.5), 8) decreasing 1.5°C every three weeks (D0.5) 


## Set up details

### Microcosms

Experimental microcosms consisted of lidded petri dishes (diameter 100 mm, height 25 mm) containing 50 ml of medium. 

### Nutrients

Medium consisted of Chalkley’s solution (Thompson et al. 1988), which provided essential salts, and 0.05 g l21 of protist pellet which provided organic nutrients.

### Bacteria

The medium was inoculated on day -14 with the bacteria Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens and incubated at 20°C. 

### Species and community set up

On day -10, 200 individuals of each of the species were added to each litre of medium, incubated at 20°C, and left to reach high densities. On day 0, the first day of the experiment, the medium was homogenised and 50 ml added to each of 27 petri-dishes (three replicate populations of nine temperature treatments).
