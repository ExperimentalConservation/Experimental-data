## Introduction

Data from Clements, C., Worsfold, N., Warren, P., Collen, B., Blackburn, T., Clark, N., Petchey, O.  Experimentally testing an extintion estimator: Solow's  Optimal Linear Estmation model.Journal of Animal Ecology, 82, p345-354.

## Structure

Jar - a unique number for each microcosm. 

Species - the species ID contained in each jar. Jars can contain 1-4 species.

Day - Day on which the data were recorded

Treatment - temperature treatment in degrees C (15 or 20). Temperatures kept constant through time.

Replicate - Replicate number for each unique set of treatment and community combinations.

Community - The identities of all of the species in a jar. For jars containing a single species this is just a single species name, for those containing multiple species this is a list of species names. 

Community.Complexity - The number of species in a jar (from 1 to 4).

td - the abundance of a species in a jar.

## Treatments

There was a single temperature treatment (microcosms kept at either 15 or 20 degrees C). 

## Set up details

### Microcosms
Microcosms were lidded Petri dishes with a diameter of 100mm. Each contained 50mL of protist media. 

### Nutrients

The medium solution contained 0!1 g of crushed protozoa pellets (Carolina Biological Supply, USA) per litre of Chalkley’s medium (Thompson, Rhodes & Pettman 1988).

### Bacteria

The medium was inoculated with the bacteria Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Serratia marcescens on day -2.

### Communities

There were 15 different communities set up at the beginning of the experiment. These featured every combination of the species P. caudatum, Loxocephalus, Blepharisma japonicum, and Colpidium striatum in communities of 1, 2, 3, and 4 species:

 [1] P.caudatum                                           [2] Loxocephalus                                         [3] Colpidium                                            [4] Blepharisma                                          [5] Paramecium caudatum + Loxocephalus                   [6] Paramecium caudatum + Blepharisma                    [7] Paramecium caudatum + Colpidium                      [8] Loxocephalus + Blepharisma                           [9] Loxocephalus + Colpidium                            [10] Blepharisma + Colpidium                             [11] P.caudatum + Loxocephalus + Blepharisma             [12] P.caudatum + Loxocephalus + Colpidium               [13] P.caudatum + Blepharisma + Colpidium                [14] Loxocephalus + Blepharisma + Colpidium              [15] P. caudatum + Loxocephalus + Blepharisma + Colpidium
