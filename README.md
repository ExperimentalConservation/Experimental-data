# Experimental-data

## Introduction

This is a repository for experimental data generated by the Experimental Ecology and Conservation group (@ExpEcoCons). Data here dates back to Clements et al. (2013) and consists of both protist microcosms data (the majority) and recently generated Collembola microcosm data. The aim is to make the data transparent and accessible to collaborators and for future projects, with metadata specifying treatments/species/conditions etc. Where relevant it will also include 3D models used for the experiments (2019 onwards) and 3D printer settings used to generate water tight prints.

## Structure

The repository will be split into different folders (experiments) containing metadata etc. 

## Acknowledgements 

The following (in no particular order) have either contributed to the collection of the data in this repository or the design of the experiments.
