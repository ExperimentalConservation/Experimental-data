# Experimental-data

## Introduction

Data from Wolfe, E., Hammill, E., Memmott, J., Clements, C. Different tactics are needed to preserve specialist versus generalist predators in protected areas.

## Structure

Microcosm - a unique code for each microcosm.

Replicate - replicate number for each unique set of landscape configuration and dispersal regime combinations.

Patch number - the number of patches in a microcosm, either 1, 4, or 6.

Heterogeneity - the distribution of patch size in a microcosm, either homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Matrix dispersal - the matrix dispersal regime, either none, low, or high, corresponding to mortality level.

Corridor dispersal - the corridor dispersal regime, either none, low, or high, corresponding to dispersal frequency.

Colpidium striatum - density of C.striatum at day 21

Blepharisma japonicum - density of B.japonicum at day 21

Spirostomum teres - density of S.teres at day 21

Paramecium caudatum - density of P.caudatum at day 21

Euplotes patella - density of E.patella at day 21

Didinium nasutum - density of D.nasutum at day 21

Stentor coeruleus - density of S.coeruleus at day 21

Dileptus anser - density of D.anser at day 21

## Treatments

There were 45 possible treatments consisting of five landscape configurations factorially crossed with nine dispersal regimes.

Landscape configuration treatments:

SL: one single patch
4-Homogeneous: four equal-sized, unconnected patches arranged in a ring
4-Heterogeneous: 2 x 2 different-sized unconnected patches arranged in a ring. 
6-Homogeneous: six equal-sized, unconnected patches arranged in a ring.
6-Heterogeneous: 3 x 2 different-sized unconnceted patches arranged in a ring.

Dispersal regimes:

Three types of matrix dispersal factorially crossed with three types of corridor dispersal
Matrix dispersal: no dispersal, low mortality, high mortality.
Corridor dispersal: no dispersal, low frequency, high frequency.

## Set up details

### Microcosms

Microcosms were 3D-printed black dishes, all 13mm in depth. 
Single large (one patch) microcosms contained 48mL protist media.
Four-patch homogeneous contained 12ml in each patch. 
Four-patch heterogeneous contained 16ml in two patches and 8 ml in two patches. Six-patch homogeneous contained 8ml in each patch.
Six-patch heterogeneous contained 4ml in three patches and 12ml in three patches. 
Each microcosm therefore contained a total of 48ml protist media.

### Nutrients

The medium solution contained 0.5g of crushed protozoa pellets (Blades Biological LTD, UK) per litre of spring water (Tesco Ashbeck English natural mineral water).

### Bacteria

The medium was inoculated with the bacteria Psuedomonas fluorescencs, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococus luteus on day -5.

### Communities

At the beginning of the experiment, each microcosm was set up with the same community of 8 protists. The species which made up the communities were as follows: Stentor coeruleus, Dileptus anser, Didinium nasutum, Blepharisma truncatella, Paramecium caudatum, Euplotes patella, Spirostomum teres, and Colpidium striatum.
