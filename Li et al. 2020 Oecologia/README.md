## Li et al. 2021 experimental data

##Introduction

Data from Li, D., Clements, C. F., Shan, I. L., & Memmott, J. (2021). Corridor quality affects net movement, size of dispersers, and population growth in experimental microcosms. Oecologia, 195(2), 547-556.

#Structure

There are two data sheets - count data (i.e. number of individuals) and body size data - collected from our "two patches one corridor " Collembola microcosms. 


**replicate** -  a unique code for each microcosm

**patch** - habitat patches, either source, sink (i.e. colonization patches), or corridor 

**quality** - the quality of corridors, either poor or good

**length** - the length of corridors, either long or short

**width** - the width of corridors, either wide or narrow

**date** - the date and time when microcosms are sampled

**count** - number of individuals

**bodysize** - the average size of all individuals (mm)

**food**- food was provided as unstarving.  

**times**- the times of sampling events , starts from 0, then 1, 2, 3...

**hours** - the hours since the experiment start

#Treatments

There were total 8 treatment groups, with 10 replicates in each group. It was a fully factorial experiment studying the effect of corridor length, width, and quality on the number and size of dispersers. 

**long × wide × good**: corridors are 14 cm in length and 1 cm in width and constructed in good quality 

**long × wide × poor**: corridor are 14  cm in length and 1 cm in width and constructed in poor quality

**long × narrow × good**: corridors are 14 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width and constructed in good quality 

**long × narrow × poor**: corridor are 14 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width and constructed in poor quality

**short × wide × good**: corridors are 7 cm in length and 1 cm in width and constructed in good quality 

**short × wide × poor**: corridor are 7 cm in length and 1 cm in width and constructed in poor quality

**short × narrow × good**: corridors are 7 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width and constructed in good quality 

**short × narrow × poor**: corridor are 7 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width and constructed in poor quality

##set up details

#microcosms

The microcosms were 3D printed, with two circle habitat patches connected with one corridor. The habitat patches were 5 cm in diameter, 2 cm in height. 

#plaster of Paris

Plaster of Paris (Hobbycraft LTD, UK) was mixed with black dye (Blue Lizard Reptiles LTD, UK) to created habitat patches and good quality corridors. 

#organisms

The microcosms were inoculated with soil Collembola Folsomia candida to the source patches at the beginning of the experiment (i.e. hours = 0)
