# Experimental-data

## Introduction

Data from Clements et al. (2013). 

## Structure

Jar - a unique number for each microcosm. 

Species - the species ID contained in each jar. Jars can contain 1-4 species.

Day - Day on which the data were recorded

Treatment - temperature treatment in degrees C (15 or 20). Temperatures kept constant through time.

Replicate - Replicate number for each unique set of treatment and community combinations.

Community - The identities of all of the species in a jar. For jars containing a single species this is just a single species name, for those containing multiple species this is a list of species names. 

Community.Complexity - The number of species in a jar (from 1 to 4).

td - the abundance of a species in a jar.

## Treatments

There was a single temperature treatment (microcosms kept at either 15 or 20 degrees C. 

## Set up details

### Microcosms
Microcosms were lidded Petri dishes with a diameter of 100mm. Each contained 50mL of protist media. 

### Nutrients

The medium solution contained 0!1 g of crushed protozoa pellets (Carolina Biological Supply, USA) per litre of Chalkley’s medium (Thompson, Rhodes & Pettman 1988).

### Bacteria

The medium was inoculated with the bacteria Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Serratia marcescens on day -2.
