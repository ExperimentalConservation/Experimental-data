# Experimental-data

## Introduction

Data from Clements, C., Warren, P., Collen, B., Blackburn, T., Worsfold, N., Petchey, O. Interactions between assembly order and temperature can alter both short and long-term community composition. Ecology & Evolution, 3(16): 5201–5208

## Structure

Jar - a unique number for each microcosm. 

Species - the species ID for which the abundance counts are fore. Jars can contain 1-3 species.

Community - a three letter code indicating the order in which the species were added to the jar. PLB indicates Paramecium was added on day 0, Loxocephalus on day 7, and Blepharisma on day 14. ALL indicates all species were added simultaneously on day 0. The community is one of the treatments (along with temperature). 

Replicate - Replicate number for each unique set of temperature and community combinations.

Day - Day on which the data were recorded

Temperature - temperature treatment each community was kept at in degrees C (11, 14, 17, 20, 23, or 26 degrees). Temperatures kept constant through time.

Abundance - The total abundance for each species in each jar. 



Community.Complexity - The number of species in a jar (from 1 to 4).

td - the abundance of a species in a jar.

## Treatments

There was a single temperature treatment (microcosms kept at either 15 or 20 degrees C). 

## Set up details

### Microcosms
Microcosms were lidded Petri dishes with a diameter of 100mm. Each contained 50mL of protist media. 

### Nutrients

The medium solution contained 0!1 g of crushed protozoa pellets (Carolina Biological Supply, USA) per litre of Chalkley’s medium (Thompson, Rhodes & Pettman 1988).

### Bacteria

The medium was inoculated with the bacteria Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Serratia marcescens on day -2.

### Communities

There were 15 different communities set up at the beginning of the experiment. These featured every combination of the species P. caudatum, Loxocephalus, Blepharisma japonicum, and Colpidium striatum in communities of 1, 2, 3, and 4 species:

 [1] P.caudatum                                           [2] Loxocephalus                                         [3] Colpidium                                            [4] Blepharisma                                          [5] Paramecium caudatum + Loxocephalus                   [6] Paramecium caudatum + Blepharisma                    [7] Paramecium caudatum + Colpidium                      [8] Loxocephalus + Blepharisma                           [9] Loxocephalus + Colpidium                            [10] Blepharisma + Colpidium                             [11] P.caudatum + Loxocephalus + Blepharisma             [12] P.caudatum + Loxocephalus + Colpidium               [13] P.caudatum + Blepharisma + Colpidium                [14] Loxocephalus + Blepharisma + Colpidium              [15] P. caudatum + Loxocephalus + Blepharisma + Colpidium
